# Workoutflow
Project 2

### About
Workoutflow is a web application designed for everyday people who do not know where to start at the gym. This application offers 3 different workout plans to suit different exercise goals. Once the user selects their workout the application will display a 3-4 day workout plan. 

### Current Deployment
The user can complete exercises by clicking on each exercise button. Once clicked the exercise will be removed from the current list and appear in the “workouts completed” list. In addition, a spotify playlist is available on each page to help the user stay motivated and focused during their workout. This application was created with an MVC structure, with content stored in a MySQL database.

### Future Deployment
Additional updates to the application may include additional workouts, an accordion display for the playlist, user login, and the workout plan pages updating without reloading.
